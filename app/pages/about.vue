    <ProseH1>About</ProseH1>
    <ProseP>
      Born, and raised in the beautiful mountain town of Bend, Oregon I've been incredibly fortunate to live in a tech focused community that is passionate about the outdoors.

    <ProseP>
      I started my software career at a company called G5 in Bend (later purchased by RealPage) as a QA engineer writing E2E tests using Selenium, Ruby, and Rails.
      It was in that role where I gained a deep respect for best practices, UX, accessability, and those are values I carry in my development still.
