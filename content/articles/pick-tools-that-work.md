# Vite is your best friend

The NextJS team recently came out with [Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack), their Rust based solution for replacing [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). While this led to a Rails-like upgrade path for developers, providing trust that they can just bump their framework version, and things will work.

That easy upgrade came with a price though; a proprietary tool, that isn't necessarily extensible by teams, and locks you into an ecosystem.

## Why didn't Vercel use Vite?

[Evan You touched on this in a podcast (link timestamped)](https://youtu.be/quEc5ZI3_Ys?t=2252) essentially Vercel wanted an easy upgrade path, however the Vite team did have a proof-of-concept put together for them.
